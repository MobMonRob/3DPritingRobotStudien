# T3_3101 Research Project

This directory contains the complete LaTeX sources and supporting materials for the student thesis on advanced 3D printing robotics.

## Project Overview
The T3_3101 research project investigates multi-axis 3D printing using robotic arms, focusing on:

1. Non-planar slicing algorithms for complex geometries
2. Kinematics optimization for robotic 3D printing
