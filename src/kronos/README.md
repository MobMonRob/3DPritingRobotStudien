# KRONOS â€“ Kinematic Robotic Operations & Navigation Orchestration System

KRONOS is a specialized library for robotic kinematics, motion primitives, and control utilities designed specifically for 3D printing robots.

## Features
- Rigid-body kinematics and transformations
- Advanced motion primitives with acceleration profiles
- Trajectory generation and blending
- Real-time control interfaces for robotics hardware
- Calibration utilities for robotic arms

## Current Status
The library is under active development. The public header `kronos.h` provides the core API interface through the `Kronos` class, which will be expanded with comprehensive kinematics functionality.

## References
- Robotics libraries and papers referenced in the implementation
- Mathematical foundations for kinematics solvers
