# MEDUSA â€“ Multi-dimensional Extrusion & Dimensional Unified Slicing Algorithm

MEDUSA is an advanced slicing and toolpath planning library for multi-axis 3D printing beyond traditional planar layers.

## Features
- Multi-dimensional slicing strategies for complex geometries
- Non-planar extrusion path planning
- Toolpath optimization for multi-axis printers

## Integration with KRONOS
MEDUSA generates optimized toolpaths that can be directly consumed by the KRONOS library for motion planning and execution, creating a complete pipeline from 3D model to robot motion.
